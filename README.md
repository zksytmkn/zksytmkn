## ✨ Hi there ✨

I'm a web developer with two years of experience.  
I've used the following languages and Tools in practical settings,  
including the development of sales support systems and e-commerce sites,  
as well as in personal development endeavors. 🏃  

While I'm still honing my skills, I'm committed to collective growth. 🥳
